## Introduction

This bootcamp module focused on frontend development, starting from the basics of HTML and CSS and progressing to JavaScript fundamentals and React.

## HTML and CSS

You began by mastering the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of web development. The following concepts were covered:

- Creating structured and semantically meaningful HTML markup.
- Styling elements with CSS, including layout design, colors, fonts, and more.
- Implementing Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
- Designing forms and handling user input.
- Utilizing Media Queries for responsive design across different devices.
- Creating animations using CSS Transform and Transition properties.
- Enhancing productivity with Tailwind CSS and SCSS/SASS.

## JavaScript Fundamentals

In the JavaScript module, you explored the core concepts of the language and gained a strong foundation for frontend interactivity. Concepts covered include:

- Working with input values and conditional statements.
- Understanding switch statements and the return keyword.
- Exploring essential Number methods for numerical operations.
- Manipulating arrays using various array methods.
- Implementing loops, including the for loop and map function.
- Adding interactivity with event listeners.
- Accessing and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Utilizing object literals, the Date object, and the Window and Browser objects.

## Working with RESTful APIs

You learned how to connect frontend applications with backend services by fetching data from RESTful APIs. This involved:

- Making asynchronous requests using `fetch` and handling responses.
- Processing JSON data and populating the DOM with fetched content.

## Introduction to React

The final part of the module introduced you to React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You covered the following topics:

- Understanding React components and props.
- Managing component state using the `useState` hook.
- Implementing side effects and lifecycle management with the `useEffect` hook.
- Navigating between pages using `react-router-dom`.
- Managing environment variables with `.env` files.
- Sharing state using the `useContext` hook.
- Fetching data from RESTful APIs and rendering it in React components.

## Projects

Throughout the module, you had the opportunity to work on various projects that reinforced your learning and allowed you to apply your skills in real-world scenarios. These projects included building responsive web pages, interactive forms, data-driven UIs, and dynamic React applications.
